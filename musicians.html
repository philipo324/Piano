          <p>Born on March 31, 1685 (N.S.), in Eisenach, Thuringia, Germany,
          Johann Sebastian Bach had a prestigious musical lineage and took on
          various organist positions during the early 18th century, creating
          famous compositions like "Toccata and Fugue in D minor." Some of his
          best-known compositions are the "Mass in B Minor," the "Brandenburg
          Concertos" and "The Well-Tempered Clavier." Bach died in Leipzig,
          Germany, on July 28, 1750. Today, he is considered one of the greatest
          Western composers of all time.</p>

          <p>Baroque composer George Handel was born February 23, 1685, in Halle,
          Germany. In 1704 Handel made his debut as an opera composer with
          Almira. He produced several operas with the Royal Academy of Music
          before forming the New Royal Academy of Music in 1727. When Italian
          operas fell out of fashion, he started composing oratorios, including
          Messiah. George Handel died April 14, 1759, in London, England.</p>

          <p>Born on March 4, 1678, in Venice, Italy, Antonio Vivaldi was
          ordained as a priest though he instead chose to follow his passion for
          music. A prolific composer who created hundreds of works, he became
          renowned for his concertos in Baroque style, becoming a highly
          influential innovator in form and pattern. He was also known for his
          operas, including Argippo and Bajazet. He died on July 28, 1741.</p>

          <p>Composer Ludwig van Beethoven was baptized on December 17, 1770, in
          Bonn, Germany. He was an innovator, widening the scope of sonata,
          symphony, concerto and quartet, and combining vocals and instruments in
          a new way. His personal life was marked by a struggle against deafness,
          and some of his most important works were composed during the last 10
          years of his life, when he was quite unable to hear.</p>

          <p>Born on January 27, 1756, in Salzburg, Austria, Wolfgang Amadeus
          Mozart was a musician capable of playing multiple instruments who
          started playing in public at the age of 6. Over the years, Mozart
          aligned himself with a variety of European venues and patrons,
          composing hundreds of works that included sonatas, symphonies, masses,
          concertos and operas, marked by vivid emotion and sophisticated
          textures.</p>

          <p>Franz Joseph Haydn was among the creators of the fundamental genres
          of classical music, and his influence upon later composers is immense.
          Haydn’s most celebrated pupil was Ludwig van Beethoven, and his musical
          form casts a huge shadow over the music of subsequent composers such as
          Schubert, Mendelssohn and Brahms.</p>

          <p>Born on March 1, 1810, in Zelazowa Wola, Poland, Frédéric Chopin,
          grew up in a middle-class family. He published his first composition at
          age 7 and began performing one year later. In 1832, he moved to Paris,
          socialized with high society and was known as an excellent piano
          teacher. His piano compositions were highly influential. He died of
          tuberculosis and ill health on October 17, 1849, in Paris, France.</p>

          <p>Composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born on May 7, 1840, in
          Vyatka, Russia. His work was first publicly performed in 1865. In 1868,
          his First Symphony was well-received. In 1874, he established himself
          with Piano Concerto No.1 in B-flat Minor. Tchaikovsky resigned from the
          Moscow Conservatory in 1878, and spent the rest of his career composing
          yet more prolifically. He died in St. Petersburg on November 6,
          1893.</p>

          <p>Born in Germany on May 22, 1813, Richard Wagner went on to become
          one of the world's most influential—and controversial—composers. He is
          famous for both his epic operas, including the four-part, 18-hour Ring
          Cycle, as well as for his anti-semitic writings, which, posthumously,
          made him a favorite of Adolf Hitler. There is evidence that Wagner's
          music was played at the Dachau concentration camp to "re-educate" the
          prisoners. Wagner had a tumultuous love life, which involved several
          scandalous affairs. He died of a heart attack in Venice on February 13,
          1883.&lt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

          education and won a scholarship to boarding school. Although he was
          never rich, the composer's work gained recognition and popularity,
          noted for bridging classical and romantic composition. He died in 1828
          in Vienna, Austria.</p>

          concert halls. As an adult, he toured extensively throughout Europe. He
          had an affair and children with Marie díAgoult, and later lived with
          Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. By his death, he had written
          more than 700 compositions.</p>

          <p>Claude Debussy was born into a poor family in France in 1862, but
          his obvious gift at the piano sent him to the Paris Conservatory at age
          11. At age 22, he won the Prix de Rome, which financed two years of
          further musical study in the Italian capital. After the turn of the
          century, Debussy established himself as the leading figure of French
          music. During World War I, while Paris was being bombed by the German
          air force, he succumbed to colon cancer at the age of 55.</p>
